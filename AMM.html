<p>💛The product ensures that highlighters won’t stop functioning, even after you leave the cap open. The tip of the highlighter is durable and sustainable. Sometimes, you receive a refill if you bought a single highlighter. Since the highlighters are water-based inks, it doesn’t cause any toxic things to occur. The products usually come with two sizes; 2mm and 5mm which is appropriate to both artists and writers or readers.💛 </p>
